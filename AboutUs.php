        <h1>Purpose of our Website<h1>

    <div class="purpose">
            <p> ● The purpose of the Team Trees Info Update website is to inform the masses what is the Team Trees organization
                and encourage people to donate any amount towards <br> planting trees for our future. <br><br> ● Deforestation is a problem we face today,
                 It can have good effects (converting forest lands to farms) but also bad effects (landslides and flashfloods). <br><br> ● With this in mind, 
                we can recover from deforestation by donating. All donations goes towards the Arbor Day Foundation a tree planting organization that pledges <br> to plant one tree for 
                every U.S. dollar donated. The Arbor Day Foundation began planting in January 2020 and plans to end "no later than December 2022". <br><br> ●The reason we took part
                in this project, because we are all nature lovers and are open to help with anything for a good cause. So the oppurtunity to create a website for 
                TeamTrees and to encourage people to donate for the future of our planet is what motivates me throughout this project. <br><br>
                ● To assist in achieving and raising awareness of SDGs 13 and 15 (Climate Action & Life On Land). <p>
